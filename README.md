# Heat-Signature-Replay-Redo
streamlined program to record and edit Heat Signature clips into realtime speed 

## Credits
Much of this comes thanks to two people:
* Random Davis (www.youtube.com/user/r2blend) for his interface for reading memory with Python, and
* @DurryQuill from the Suspicious Developments Discord who found the in-game variable address that makes this entire program possible to begin with

A code snippet was also adapted from www.thepythoncode.com/article/make-screen-recorder-python.

# How To
1. Download the latest release.
2. Extract `heatSigReplay.zip`
